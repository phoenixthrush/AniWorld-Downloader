## :construction: AniWorld-Downloader has been rewritten

AniWorld-Downloader's `next` branch has been fully rewritten for better speed and readability using OOP principles. It’s now at the same stage as the main branch and ready for testing, so I highly recommend using it. Check it out [here](https://github.com/phoenixthrush/AniWorld-Downloader/tree/next).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Version**: Ensure you have **[Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** or higher installed.  
   - **Note**: Although Python 3.13 is available, it does not include `windows-curses`, which is needed for the menu to work on Windows. To avoid issues, please use **Python 3.12** until `windows-curses` is updated. Check for updates [here](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/#files).

  <summary>Python Installation Tutorial (Windows only)</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/phoenixthrush/AniWorld-Downloader/blob/main/.github/Python_Add_to_Path_Tutorial.png?raw=true" alt="Python Installation Tutorial">

**Note:** If you've restarted the terminal and `aniworld` isn't being recognized, you have two options:
- Add `aniworld` to your PATH so it can be found globally.
- Run `python -m aniworld`, which should work without adding it to the PATH.

## Usage

### Running with Menu

To launch AniWorld Downloader with an interactive menu, use:

```shell
aniworld
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Command-Line Examples

AniWorld Downloader supports various command-line options for downloading and streaming anime without using the interactive menu. This allows access to advanced features not available in the menu (e.g., `--aniskip`, `--keep-watching`, `--syncplay-password`).

### Example 1: Download a Single Episode

To download episode 1 of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba":

```shell
aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1
```

### Example 2: Download Multiple Episodes

To download multiple episodes of "Demon Slayer":

```shell
aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-2
```

### Example 3: Watch Episodes with Aniskip

To watch an episode while skipping intros and outros:

```shell
aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 --action Watch --aniskip
```

### Example 4: Syncplay with Friends

To syncplay a specific episode with friends:

```shell
aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 --action Syncplay --keep-watching
```

#### Language Options for Syncplay

You can choose different languages for yourself and your friends:

- For German Dub:

    ```shell
    aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 --action Syncplay --keep-watching --language "German Dub" --aniskip
    ```

- For English Sub:

    ```shell
    aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 --action Syncplay --keep-watching --language "English Sub" --aniskip
    ```

**Note:** Anyone watching the same anime (regardless of episode) will automatically join the room if Syncplay is enabled. To restrict access to strangers, set a password for the room:

```shell
aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 --action Syncplay --keep-watching --language "English Sub" --aniskip --syncplay-password beans
```

### Example 5: Download with Specific Provider and Language

To download an episode using the VOE provider with English subtitles:

```shell
aniworld --episode https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-1/episode-1 --provider VOE --language "English Sub"
```

### Example 6: Use an Episode File

You can download episodes listed in a text file. Here’s an example of what the text file (`test.txt`) should look like:

```
# The whole anime
https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/alya-sometimes-hides-her-feelings-in-russian

# The whole Season 2
https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/staffel-2

# Only Season 3 Episode 13
https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/kaguya-sama-love-is-war/staffel-3/episode-13
```

To download the episodes specified in the file, use:

```shell
aniworld --episode-file /Users/goofball/Downloads/test.txt --language "German Dub"
```

You can also combine this with `Watch` and `Syncplay` actions, along with other arguments as needed.

## FAQ

#### Download and Viewing Recommendations
In older versions, the default provider for both downloading and watching with syncplay and mpv was Vidoza. However, since Vidoza and Streamtape throttle download speeds, I recommend using **VOE** for downloads, as it can fully utilize your bandwidth.

**Drawback of VOE:**
- Many fragments can be invalid, affecting playback with mpv. While downloads using yt-dlp work fine, invalid fragments may cause scenes to skip or glitch, leading to noticeable disruptions, especially during syncplay, where different fragment issues among viewers can result in annoying jumps.

**Current Recommendations:**
- **Download in this order:**  
  VOE > Vidoza > Streamtape

- **For viewing in mpv or syncplay:**  
  Vidoza > Streamtape > VOE

### s.to & bs.to Support
I previously had support for s.to in a separate branch, but it is now unmaintained and untested. Currently, I do not plan to re-implement support for s.to, as I've focused on stabilizing the existing code. Before adding new providers, I need to streamline the backend, which is somewhat messy due to redundant functions and fetches from recent feature additions.

**Note on Adding s.to Support:**
- Adding s.to support would not be difficult—it only requires one fewer fetch than Aniworld's current method to access streaming providers. If anyone is interested in contributing to this effort, I would be happy to merge the addition.

There are already other tools that support s.to. For terminal-based viewing of s.to, check out my friend's project called **[gucken](https://github.com/Commandcracker/gucken)**—he’s doing great work there. 

Regarding Aniworld’s claim of hosting 1,000+ license-free anime, it’s worth noting that they also stream new shows that may require subscriptions elsewhere. Supporting s.to could mean indirectly accessing copyrighted content, such as Netflix originals. As I do not host any content but fetch it directly from streaming providers, I am not liable for any issues arising from downloading anime.

Feel free to contribute! Any help is appreciated, and I’d be happy to merge in support for s.to or bs.to if it gets added.

## Support

I’ve received several reports from users experiencing unexpected menu quits. Recently, streaming providers have started blocking IP addresses from downloading. You can bypass this by using a VPN. You might try using the `--use-playwright` option instead, though it's still experimental and may not be very effective. Additionally, run aniworld with the `--debug` flag.

This will typically reveal a timeout error, indicating the domain couldn’t be reached or another issue.

### How to Get Help
If you still need assistance with AniWorld Downloader, you can:

- **File a report** via the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/phoenixthrush/AniWorld-Downloader/issues) page.
- **Contact me directly** via email at [contact@phoenixthrush.com](mailto:contact@phoenixthrush.com), on Matrix `@phoenixthrush:matrix.org`, or on Discord `phoenixthrush`.

While I do respond to emails, opening a GitHub issue is preferable, even for installation questions, so others can find solutions too. However, I’m still happy to help via email if you prefer.

If you enjoy AniWorld Downloader and want to support the project, please consider starring the repository on GitHub. It’s a small gesture that means a lot and motivates me to keep improving the project.
